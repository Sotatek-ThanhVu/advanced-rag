A mix of ob-gyn, abdominal, vascular and small parts lectures provide a well-rounded review of common clinical ultrasound procedures. Topics are presented in a case-based approach providing updated AIUM recommendations, protocol optimization, tips, and pitfalls so registrants can expand their clinical practices. Faculty have been selected for their teaching ability, as well as for their expertise.\nTarget Audience\nThis course is designed to educate those who order, perform, and interpret clinical ultrasound studies. It should be particularly valuable for diagnostic imaging physicians, ob-gyn physicians, vascular surgeons, and referring physicians who utilize ultrasound to evaluate the clinical status of their patients. The symposium should also be valuable for sonographers who perform these procedures.\nVisit the CME Course Webpage ›",

The course will highlight state of the art MR techniques for musculoskeletal, abdominal, cardiovascular, and breast imaging, and include updates on some related topics such as PET/MRI, abdominal MRI protocols, cardiac MRI, and MR guided intervention for the prostate. The course is intended to be practical rather than theoretical in nature, and the faculty is composed mostly of practicing radiologists.\nOn completing the course, attendees should feel more comfortable implementing and interpreting some of these techniques in their practice. The course would be ideal for those looking to expand or offer new clinical MRI services or improve confidence in diagnosis with some of the newer MRI techniques and pulse sequences.\nAttendance at this Mayo course does not indicate nor guarantee competence or proficiency in the performance of any procedures which may be discussed or taught in this course.\nVisit the CME Course Webpage ›",

    "description": "The 2023 Annual meeting of the FRS & FRBMA will focus on strategic planning for leadership and collaboration across healthcare systems and industry to help radiologists deliver optimal patient care. This year’s theme is “Radiology: A Synergy of Technology and Patient Care.” Friday evening exhibitors and members come together for the popular Wine and Cheese Reception in the Exhibit Hall. We are always very grateful for the exhibitors’ support of the FRS and the FRBMA and appreciate the opportunity to thank them personally. There are additional opportunities to interact with the exhibitors on Saturday as the breakfast and coffee break will be held in the Exhibit Hall, and lunch with the exhibitors allows for continued discussion and interaction.\nThe FRBMA Session begins on Friday afternoon with Dr. Richard L. Duszak, MD, FACR, FSIR, FRBMA (“Radiology Management Keynote Address”), Dr. Lawrence R. Muroff, MD, FACR (“Good to Great: Applying Corporate Principles to Radiology Practices”), Ted Burnes, MPA (“Legislative Initiatives Affecting the Practice of Radiology and Patient Care”) and David Verinder, CEO of Sarasota Memorial Healthcare System (“Where will Florida hospitals position themselves over the next 5 years with the elimination of hospital Certificate of Need”). The FRBMA joins the FRS Diagnostic General Session on Saturday morning with an outstanding lineup of nationally recognized speakers featuring Dr. Frank J. Lexa, MD, MBA, FACR (“Venture Capital and Private Equity Models in Health care: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly” for The Steven G. Miles, MD, FACR, Radiology Keynote Socioeconomic Address), Jacqueline Bello, MD, FACR, Chair of the ACR Board of Chancellors (“ACR Update”), Rich Duszak, MD, FACR, FSIR, FRBMA (“Radiology Workforce Planning: Goldilock’s Lessons in Subspecialization” for The Philip S. Cook, MD, FACR, FSIR Strategic Issue Lecture) and Ron Howrigon from Fulcrum Strategies (“Value-Based Payment Models: the Present and the Future”).\nSaturday afternoon will feature Dr. Frank J. Lexa, MD, MBA, FACR (“Leaders and Leadership: Both the Cause of and the Solution to Burnout in Radiology”) and Dr. Lori Deitte, MD, FACR, FAUR (“Leadership Journey from the FRS to National and Academic Leadership” during The Dr. Lawrence R. Muroff Radiology Leadership Lecture) followed by the resident poster symposium and breakout sessions for Radiation Oncology and the Resident and Fellow Section. The afternoon will conclude with Barbara Rubel (“What Happens When You Fail MIPs”) and Eliot L. Siegel, MD, FACR, FSIIM (“What You Need to Know about AI for Your Practice in 2023”).\nThe Gold Medal Reception and Cocktail Party, our marquee event, will be held early Saturday evening to honor the FRS, the FRBMA Above and Beyond Award, and The LaDonna Nichols Lifetime Achievement Award recipient. Other outstanding FRS and FRBMA members will be recognized for their contributions to the practice of radiology throughout the year. An early start time for this event allows attendees and exhibitors the opportunity to enjoy the rest of the evening on their own.\nSunday, begins with the Charles D. Williams, MD, FACR Legacy Lecture and Breakfast, presented by Tony Mancuso, MD , Chair of Radiology at University of Florida (“It’s Time to Modernize Radiology Education”) and the Clinical Keynote Lecture presented by John Kaufman, MD, MS, Chair of Dotter Department of Interventional Radiology at Oregon Health & Science University (“The Past Was Great, but the Future Looks Even Better: One Person’s View of IR”) followed by three clinical hot topic lectures given by junior faculty from programs around the state of Florida.\nVisit the CME Course Webpage ›\nView the Course Brochure ›",

    "description": "Introduction to Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Course with Interventional Cadaver Lab provides participants a comprehensive introduction to musculoskeletal ultrasound on topics based on AIUM practice guidelines. These courses are taught by leading musculoskeletal ultrasound experts that incorporates comprehensive lectures on upper and lower extremity applications, live scanning demonstrations, and interactive case presentations featuring a 3:1 participant to faculty hands-on scan ratio with live models, phantoms and human cadaver labs.\nPerforming ultrasound-guided interventions requires a strong knowledge base pertaining to scanning techniques, recognition of normal anatomy, pathologic conditions, and needle-guidance techniques. The use of human cadaveric specimens allows the learner to augment the scanning and interventional skills in order to immediately begin integrating the skills into clinical practice.\nThese courses are held at multiple dates throughout the year, making it the perfect course for both local participants and participants traveling to Florida. For the most comprehensive MSK Ultrasound education, combine the Introduction to MSK Ultrasound program with either the Advanced/Interventional or Regenerative Medicine MSK program. The Advanced/Interventional and the Regenerative Medicine MSK courses both include a cadaver workshop to further enhance your interventional skills for increased confidence and competence. Tuition discounts are available for the combined programs along with cost-savings related to travel expenses.\nVisit the CME Course Webpage ›",

Speakers will focus not only on the conventional radiographic findings and differentials for acute/critical pathology, but will discuss new and innovative imaging and treatment technology.
