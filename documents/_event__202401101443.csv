Welcome to the VIRTUAL SANTA FE IN THE VIRTUAL BIG APPLE course!  Because of the many travel challenges confronting us due to the pandemic, we are offering this VIRTUAL version of our live 25th Anniversary MAMMOGRAPHY IN SANTA FE, which is on the ground in Santa Fe, August 2-6.  In lieu of our long-standing “Breast Imaging in the Big Apple” conference in New York, we are moving our Virtual Santa Fe meeting into the Big Apple time slot, December 10-12!
This VIRTUAL course cannot offer the unique hands-on interactive workshops of the meeting on the ground, but we are able to offer the ENTIRE DIDACTIC PROGRAM of 24 lectures presented by our world-class faculty at the Santa Fe conference on the ground in August.  These lectures will provide attendees with an overview of both basic principles of breast imaging and cutting edge advanced concepts, all designed to provide valuable practical information to bolster the skills of today’s busy breast imager.  We look forward to your joining us virtually for a weekend with the Legends of Breast Imaging – TABAR, STAVROS, CARDEÑOSA, NEWSTEAD, PORTER, & COMSTOCK, AMONG OTHERS – who have taken breast imaging to the next level with their brilliant teaching at our Santa Fe course over the past 25 years!

This symposium is structured as a practical, clinically focused review of diagnostic ultrasound. A mix of ob-gyn, abdominal, vascular and small parts lectures provide a well-rounded review of common clinical ultrasound procedures. Topics are presented in a case-based approach providing updated AIUM recommendations, protocol optimization, tips, and pitfalls so registrants can expand their clinical practices. Faculty have been selected for their teaching ability, as well as for their expertise.
Target Audience
This course is designed to educate those who order, perform, and interpret clinical ultrasound studies. It should be particularly valuable for diagnostic imaging physicians, ob-gyn physicians, vascular surgeons, and referring physicians who utilize ultrasound to evaluate the clinical status of their patients. The symposium should also be valuable for sonographers who perform these procedures.

The course will highlight state of the art MR techniques for musculoskeletal, abdominal, cardiovascular, and breast imaging, and include updates on some related topics such as PET/MRI, abdominal MRI protocols, cardiac MRI, and MR guided intervention for the prostate. The course is intended to be practical rather than theoretical in nature, and the faculty is composed mostly of practicing radiologists.
On completing the course, attendees should feel more comfortable implementing and interpreting some of these techniques in their practice. The course would be ideal for those looking to expand or offer new clinical MRI services or improve confidence in diagnosis with some of the newer MRI techniques and pulse sequences.
Attendance at this Mayo course does not indicate nor guarantee competence or proficiency in the performance of any procedures which may be discussed or taught in this course.

All subspecialties and imaging modalities will be covered with lectures divided into the following sections: neuroimaging, musculoskeletal imaging, gastrointestinal imaging, genitourinary imaging, ultrasound imaging, cardiothoracic imaging, pediatric imaging, breast imaging, vascular & interventional radiology, and nuclear medicine. Lectures are provided by a distinguished group of faculty with a wealth of clinical and teaching experience, each covering the key clinical and imaging findings for differentials within common imaging gamuts, as well as characteristic “Aunt Minnie” cases. Our goal is to provide attendees with a comprehensive gamut-based approach to image interpretation with helpful pearls to help distinguish between entities on a list of differential diagnoses.
Objectives:
Formulate gamut-based differential diagnoses for key imaging findings across all radiology subspecialties and imaging modalities.
Distinguish amongst differential diagnoses based upon characteristic imaging findings.
Recognize & identify diagnoses with classic imaging findings, in which there is no differential diagnosis.
Implement and optimize imaging modalities and protocols to improve diagnostic accuracy.
Recognize appropriate indications for image-guided interventional procedures, as well as management of potential complications.

These courses are taught by leading musculoskeletal ultrasound experts that incorporates comprehensive lectures on upper and lower extremity applications, live scanning demonstrations, and interactive case presentations featuring a 3:1 participant to faculty hands-on scan ratio with live models, phantoms and human cadaver labs.
Performing ultrasound-guided interventions requires a strong knowledge base pertaining to scanning techniques, recognition of normal anatomy, pathologic conditions, and needle-guidance techniques. The use of human cadaveric specimens allows the learner to augment the scanning and interventional skills in order to immediately begin integrating the skills into clinical practice.
These courses are held at multiple dates throughout the year, making it the perfect course for both local participants and participants traveling to Florida. For the most comprehensive MSK Ultrasound education, combine the Introduction to MSK Ultrasound program with either the Advanced/Interventional or Regenerative Medicine MSK program. The Advanced/Interventional and the Regenerative Medicine MSK courses both include a cadaver workshop to further enhance your interventional skills for increased confidence and competence. Tuition discounts are available for the combined programs along with cost-savings related to travel expenses.
